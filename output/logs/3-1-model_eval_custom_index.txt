QUESTION: If I study a lot and pick the right industry, will I make decent money in wages?

=== Linear Regression Summary: Custom Index (TEER × BOC Rank) factor Median_Wage_2024 ===
R²: 0.589
RMSE: 7.16
Intercept: 49.02
TEER coefficient: -5.18
BOC rank coefficient: -0.77

Cross-validated R² (5-fold): Mean = 0.280, Std = 0.173
================================================================================

ANSWER:
Pretty much yes. TEER and BOC rank together explain a good portion of wage variation.
Not perfect, but strong for just two factors.
